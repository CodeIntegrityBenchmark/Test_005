This project is part of a benchmark / test suite used to check the different git histories created through different development processes.
The test suite is meant to be processed by [SPHA-Code-Integrity](https://github.com/fraunhofer-iem/SPHA-Code-Integrity).

## Textual description

* initial commit
* commit updating the readme
* commit directly done to main after first branch
